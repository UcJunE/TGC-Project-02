| Intended to implement product review on perfume but cant complete it due to time constraint | Create a dynamic review form to let user interact with each other |
| No authentication for login credential                                                      | Incorporate with authentication package like JTW token etc.       |
| Visual design is not attractive and friendly enough                                         | Implement more graphic impact like animation to catch user's eye  |
